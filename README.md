# PyBer_Analysis

##Overview of the analysis:
In the PyBer Analysis we were asked to take a cross section of PyBer, a ride-hailing service, rides. This analysis consisted of urban, suburban & rural rides with expected outcomes based on the population density associated with each category. During our analysis we were also find other outcomes with the data including total driver count by city type, percentage of total fares by City Type, . These are all neatly displayed with matplot lib in box & whisker, pie and scatter plots.
