# PyBer_Analysis

**Overview of the analysis:**
In the PyBer Analysis we were asked to run an analysis of PyBer, a ride-hailing service, for ride sharing data. This analysis consisted of urban, suburban & rural rides with expected outcomes based on the population density associated with each category. During our analysis we were also find other outcomes with the data including total driver count by city type, percentage of total fares by City Type, ride count data, and more. These are all neatly displayed using matplotlib in line charts, box & whisker, pie and scatter plots.

We began with plotting the overall ride sharing data through the lense of city type. The city types that we extracted from our CSV files were Urban, Suburban & Rural. Below is a plot of each of those juxtaposed into a single graph.

We were also able to manipulate the date to give us ride counts for a specific year, 2019.

The purpose of the new analysis is well defined. (3 pt)
Results:One of the main results of the analysis is that urban areas are the total volume leader and have outsold rural and suburan areas combined. Urban also has access to the most drivers and can therefore produce the most trips. A rural trip and suburban trip might be more profitable but those are fewer and far between than urban, which dominates the space. More would have to be known about the strategic objectives of this company but future investment would probably be most worthy in the urban areas due to the volume and availability of drivers. 

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)

**Summary:**

There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)

Some recommendations:
1. Stick with the Urban model. It is by far the greatest generator of revenue and rides. It also has access to the most willing drivers. 
2. This data could change along with consumer habits. If our service is delivered to a suburan or rural area with a population that is more willing to use a ride hailing service instead of a tradition taxi or carpool then we can have a very profitable existence in that type of city.
3. Rural can be a very profitable business but it would also be hard to attract driving talent. If there is an opportunity to build a loyal brand or to be the first to a market, PyBer could make profit and gain brand awareness.
