# PyBer_Analysis

**Overview of the analysis:**
In the PyBer Analysis we were asked to run an analysis of PyBer, a ride-hailing service, for ride sharing data. This analysis consisted of urban, suburban & rural rides with expected outcomes based on the population density associated with each category. During our analysis we were also find other outcomes with the data including total driver count by city type, percentage of total fares by City Type, ride count data, and more. These are all neatly displayed using matplotlib in line charts, box & whisker, pie and scatter plots.

We began with plotting the overall ride sharing data through the lense of city type. The city types that we extracted from our CSV files were Urban, Suburban & Rural. Below is a plot of each of those juxtaposed into a single graph.

We were also able to manipulate the date to give us ride counts for a specific year, 2019.

The purpose of the new analysis is well defined. (3 pt)
Results:

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)
##Summary:

There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)
